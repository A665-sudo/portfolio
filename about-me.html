        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>I am interested in computers and programming. I have experience of programming in Python, HTML, CSS and Scratch.</p>
        <p>I did start doing Scratch when I was in primary school. When I got good amount of experience, I made complex games, including space shooters, platformers and catching games.</p>
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In my spare time, when I am not programming, I enjoy learning about other technology, like operating systems on computers, laptops and tablets. I also have a collection of old phones that I like to explore.</p>
        <p>When Iâ€™m not spending time with technology, I enjoy going on trips both in England and abroad. I am currently looking forward to the summer holidays when I will go on a trip across Europe to visit multiple countries. Last year, I went on a long trip to Poland, where I visited several big cities, including the capital, Warsaw.</p>
