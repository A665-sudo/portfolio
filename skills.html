        <h2>My grades and education in secondary school</h2>
        <p>When I was doing GCSEs in Year 11, I was in secondary school and I did write exams there.</p>
        <p>I only had 4 GCSEs out of the 5 required for the entry requirements of Level 3 Digital T-Level course and all of them required Grade 5 and I didn't get them.</p>
        
        <p>Here are the grades I got when I was in my secondary school:</p>
        <ul><b>
            <li>Maths: Grade 5</li>
            <li>Science: Grade 5-5</li>
            <li>Food Technology: Grade 4</li>
        </b></ul>

        <h2>My grades and education in City of Oxford College</h2>
        <p>My course I am doing right now is Level 2 Digital foundation in City of Oxford College in Blackbird Leys campus.</p>
        <p>When I was writing this, I did complete some assignments successfully, including the Unit 1 Exam. I am also doing English.</p>
        <p>Here are the qualifications and grades I got so far:</p>
        <ul><b>
            <li>Unit 1 Exam (Digital): Awaiting grade</li>
        </b></ul>
        <p>I didn't put down the whole qualification of Level 2 Digital and GCSE English as I havn't completed the courses fully yet.</p>

        <h2>My skills</h2>
        <p>I have experience in programming, including Scratch and Python. I have experience of website development, including HTML, CSS</p>
        <p>I also have some experience of JavaScript</p>
        <p>In the future, I will be learning to drive and get my driving licence, so I can easily travel to your company.</p>
